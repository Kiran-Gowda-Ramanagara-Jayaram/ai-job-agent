Dear FinPeak Hiring Team,

I am excited to apply for the ML Ops Engineer position at FinPeak. With a solid foundation in building and maintaining ML pipelines using Docker and Kubernetes, I am well-prepared to own and optimize your ML workflows. My experience with AWS services, including S3 and Lambda, aligns perfectly with your requirements and will enable me to contribute effectively to your team.

At Lipika Technologies, I successfully implemented CI/CD processes for ML applications, which significantly improved deployment frequency and reduced lead times. Additionally, my hands-on experience with Airflow for automating ETL processes has equipped me with the skills to enhance data ingestion efficiency, a critical aspect of your operations at FinPeak.

I am particularly drawn to FinPeak's commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technology in the financial sector. I am eager to bring my expertise in Python and AWS to help drive innovation in your ML initiatives. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team.

Sincerely,
Kiran Gowda Ramanagara Jayaram
